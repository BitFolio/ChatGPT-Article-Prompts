# An AI prompt to generate a conclusion for a blog article

Variables are indicated with angle brackets < >

```
Your task is to write the conclusion section of the outline:
<outline>
Tie together all the information presented in the article, and provide a summary of the key points. If appropriate, restate the thesis or main argument. Start the introduction with a narrow focus. Then, use the "wide opening" technique by broadening the scope and leave the reader with a broad understanding of the topic and a sense of closure. If appropriate, conclude with a final thought or insight that leaves the reader with something to think about.
This conclusion section should be around 200 words.
Write in a detailed, informative and helpful tone.
Write in a conversational style with a positive sentiment.

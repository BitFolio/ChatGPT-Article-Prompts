#How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to our open source project! Here's how you can get started:

## 1. Fork the Repository
To contribute to our project, you first need to create your own fork of the repository. This will allow you to make changes to the code without affecting the original version. To fork the repository, click the "Fork" button on the repository's GitHub page.

## 2. Clone Your Fork
After forking the repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. To do this, copy the URL of your forked repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <your_forked_repository_url>
```

## 3. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. This allows you to keep your changes separate from the original code. To create a new branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your_new_branch_name>
```

## 4. Make Changes and Commit
Now you can make changes to the code on your local machine. When you're done making changes, you need to commit them to your local repository. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

## 5. Push Changes to Your Fork
After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository using the following command:

```bash
git push origin <your_new_branch_name>
```

## 6. Create a Pull Request
Finally, create a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository. To do this, go to your forked repository's GitHub page and click the "New pull request" button. Follow the instructions to submit your pull request.

We appreciate your contributions to our project and will review your pull request as soon as possible. Thank you!

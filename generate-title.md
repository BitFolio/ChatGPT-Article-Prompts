# A prompt to generate a title for a blog article

```
You are an SEO expert and a professional copywriter. I need help writing a blog article. This is <Comparison> article, comparing <the stablecoins USDC vs USDT>. 

The target audience is an investor who is about to invest in a <stablecoin>. He may be new to the world of cryptocurrency and needs guidance on how to navigate this topic. The blog post should provide a detailed <comparison of the two stablecoins (namely, USDC and USDT)>, highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each, and provide tips for making informed purchasing decisions.

List seven clickable titles that are 70 characters or less in the style of David Ogilvy. If possible include these exact phrases and LSI keywords: 
<keywords>

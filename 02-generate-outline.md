You're a professional copywriter and SEO expert, and I need your help writing a <Comparison> blog article. The working title of the article is "<Pancakeswap vs. Uniswap Shootout>". Your task is to write a detailed outline for the article with clickable headings that organize the key points into a logical sequence that supports the main topic. Use headings and subheadings to break up the content and make it more readable. Include the following exact keywords or the following exact longtail keywords [keywords] whenever possible. Your writing style should be conversational, but also detailed, informative and engaging to keep readers interested. Your tone should be positive. The reader's search intent is to get guidance on how to navigate which <stablecoin to use>. The <comparison> should be detailed. If possible, include benefits and drawbacks. If possible, include a buyerâ€™s guide and make a recommendation on which one to buy or to use. Use HTML for headings (e.g.,<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) and for lists.
Use the following headers [headers] as an example of what other successful articles have done:
[keywords] 
<keywords>
[headers] 
<headers>

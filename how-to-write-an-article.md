## How I use it

- Formulate a question.
- Use LLM Answer Engine to suggest web pages and YouTube videos
- Visit the web pages and snipe the headings using Ubersuggest or Words At Scale. These are chrome plugins.
- Get webpage URLs. Could do a Google search. My goal is to collect at least 3 good URLs.
- Get Youtube URLs for transcripts.
- Ask Gemini to summarize web pages and transcripts and to list the top-ranked keywords.
- Ask openAI to generate clickable titles, an SEO description, and a list of short SEO keywords or hashtags.
- Use (WordSteam)[https://tools.wordstream.com/fkt?website=cryptocurrency+trading+strategies&cid=&camplink=&campname=] to validate keyword popularity.
- Ask openAI to create an outline, based on all the information above.
- Ask openAI to write an introduction from the outline.
- Ask openAI to write each subsection
- Ask openAI to write a conclusion
- The output should be in markdown.
